Because they knew he was pointing the gun at people in the park... And that people felt threatened by Him which is why they called 9-1-1,0,news,"Here's what's interesting. The video shows that Tamir didn't even have the gun out when he was shot. So, if anything, he has his hands in/around his pockets/waistband when the cops come. He may have just been lifting his shirt to show the police where the gun was. Ohio is an open carry state; anyone with a licensed weapon can carry it around. I assume the police know this. So why is this kid automatically shot, when he technically has the right to be carrying a weapon?"

I think you just made that up.,0,IdiotsFightingThings,"I may be wrong, but I believe an impact from inside would create a lot of tension in the structure of the glass, which ""pulls"" tiny cracks/defects apart.

"The incentive that the agents have in honoring cypher's agreement, even though cypher would have no way of knowing whether it had been honored or not is twofold: one, as a PR exercise for the benefit of future potential turncoats; second, it doesn't cost them anything... All in all, he still ends up with the best deal (until the other fuckers mess it all up that is...)",0,comics,"Because they believe in the value of having a real, authentic experience with real, authentic people (in a dystopian sci-fi future). The problem I have with Cypher is that he demands all these awesome things but insists on not remembering *any* of it. Clearly, the Agents have no reason to honor that agreement and might wipe his memory, then make him live a miserable life. It's not like he threatened (or could threaten) the Agents with some information that might be released if he's not objectively happy and self-satisfied all the same. That being said, his bargain with the Agents of the Matrix is very relevant to this hypothetical machine. If he's got an awesome life, but he remembers the past and knows the truth, the possibility for knowledge and regret seep in. How could he ever enjoy his gains when they can be granted or taken away on a whim? Perhaps he knows that the knowledge of his betrayal will make him unhappy or that his knowledge of the ""truth"" will prevent him from forming any meaningful relationships; he'd be alone, unhappy, and surrounded by empty, vapid people. With this happiness machine, you're aware that your happiness is delusional and inauthentic. Perhaps you wouldn't care at first, but eventually hints real life will remind you that you're stupidly happy for no good reason. This will gradually diminish the effect until they're utterly dissatisfying. They're now only a reminder of how alone and miserable you actually are, despite how you outwardly feel. No one else can share in your delusions and you recognize them as being insubstantial. Putting someone else in the machine, someone who isn't aware of the machine's effect, is also going to make you unhappy because no matter how hard you try, you wouldn't be able to break their false sense of happiness. They believe they are having a convincing, authentic experience, so they experience true joy. They'd do anything to rationalize their experience and discredit your claims to the contrary. Even if you could break their delusion, you'd only gain the small, temporary satisfaction of knowing that they have been made unhappy for the rest of their life."

We've played Arteta with Flamini on occasions....,0,Gunners,To all those people saying we are going to play him together with Coquelin that not likely to happen unless as late sub. Only time wenger would play a defensive lineup is if all our attacking options are injured or limited. The whole point of buying el nenny is to replace arteta and partner ramsey in the middle and allow the team to all out attack without losing control of match. Ramsey wouldn't be out of position if we keep the ball better farther up the field. Ramsey/wilshere/ox/walcott do get preferential treatment anyways because they are the British core.

Its a little cringy because its not very good and its clearly not working on the audience but the mic cutting out and a bit of an awkward kicking-off made it a million times worse than it could have been.

Ted Mosby?,0,interestingasfuck,"Architect here. Nobody probably cares but this isn't really deconstructivism. De-con was a reaction or subversion of modernism and an opposition to the rise of post-modernism. It only really existed in that context. Post modernists said that modernism missed something by omitting ornament. Deconstructivists rejected that and said that ornament wasn't needed but instead a sort of complexification of the building's functional elements. Both rejected modernism's formal purity. Post-modernists thought modernism wasn't playful or 'delightful' enough and deconstructivists thought it wasn't intellectually self-critical enough. The architect here comes out of OMA, a firm started by Rem Koolhaas, who was decidedly not a deconstructivist, or at least didn't see himself as one. If anything Koolhaas, OMA, and this building represents post-structuralism, as there is actually a strong logic to the form of their buildings. It just may not be immediately obvious to the observer or not classically symmetrical. I suspect this tower has little of OMA's functional formal logical expression and is more or less a cool wrapper around a prestige tower. Towers are too programmatically constrained to really complexify all that much. They are also too expensive. Nothing is capricious. Any carving or removal here results in a terrace that adds huge value to the apartment it serves."

At this point we hopefully have a dessert storm type scenario where the enemy ends up cowering back into there holes, if not then Kim would be threatened with tactical nuclear weapons."

I just received an Aspire Nautilus last night after having used Kanger Protanks for awhile. I went to unscrew the bottom hardware to fill it, and the part that screws into the battery along with the airflow adjustment ring popped off. It seems like this part is just a cap and a spring that connects to the atomizer that is also screwed into the bottom base. So I fill up the tank, and then go to pop the cap back on. Everything is fine until I go to screw the tank back onto my mod (using a Smok Magneto). Now the tank keeps separating from the base that is screwed into my battery. It seems like the spring keeps pushing the tank off and the base won't stay connected. Is it broken or is there something I'm missing? In the manual, it shows the base and bottom hardware all screwing off as one piece and doesn't show the cap part as separate. Hope this is making sense, I can clarify if anyone has questions. It does work however. I need to press down on the tank so that it contacts with the base which is already screwed into the battery. If I do that I can get some pulls but I need to apply a good deal of force to the top of the tank to make it maintain contact with the battery. Anyways, any help would be greatly appreciated. I don't think the vendor would take a return since I already filled the tank."

This appears (as a neutral observer who skimmed all three subs) to be an accurate summary.,0,Christianity,"1. Brokehugs and mothersub have a conflict over crossposting.

Still, it is clearly a dick move. Somewhere in this time, BH goes public again. 3. This gets reported to outsider, who messages the BH mods. They say they are not okay with it, remove the post. The guilty party defends themselves, saying it isn't doxxing. Outsider continues to press the issue, as well as a couple other complaints in various places. 4. Outsider is banned from brokehugs. 5.

Because men don't taste as good.,1,TheRedPill,"Why The Pursuit of Women? Have you ever stopped and asked yourself why you put women in a pedestal and why you pursue them so much? Pro 1: You can get company for a while. Pro 2: You can experience sex. Pro 3: You might feel better with yourself. Pro 1 can be achieved through lots of different means not necessarily requiring women, or said better: not necessarily having to be in a 'relationship' with women. As the internet and other technology advances there will be more and more ways to be in company of other people. And I don't mean strictly virtually, more and more real life options will open. If you train yourself to only be happy in the company of women, you will end up having your women 'life partner' which will very probably make you miserable. Relationships between a man and a women deteriorate and become a chore. It removes your happiness and freedom just to comply with some social role. When you could have just have lots of good friends and hang with them when you want. Pro 2, yeah sex is good I guess, but doesn't it very often lead to pregnancy, isn't the sex drive just a mechanism to perpetuate the species? Think about all the unwanted pregnancies that happened because someone was horny and in pursuit of sex. Once it happens you are responsible for the kid and the mom, you are stuck to having to interact and support a woman you might despise for the rest of your life. Also you could impregnate an ugly or terrible women, and will bring ugly kids to the world raised by a terrible mom. But to be fair, reproduction is not really a bad thing, your choice if you want to be a designated breeder. Pro 3 might be just a simple social construct, you were raised to think you were meant to chase women, have sex, spend a lot of your time with them, be a man. It can easily be altered if you think about it in a certain way, and you wont care about it again, thus not being a problem anymore."

This is the year of MONEY. Also, this year, October will have 5 Sundays, 5 Mondays &amp; 5 Saturdays. This happens only once every 823 years. These particular years are known as Moneybag years.

As soon as that had finished, we got connection interrupted and we got the Forrest. Tried to go and have a look in theatre but it hasn't saved because of the crash. I don't know if this is a step or it happens all the time, but it seemed weird that marwga was spawning in and this had a purple light shining up. Has anyone else experienced this?"

"Just to piss him off even further put all that money into solar panels and water tanks, grow vegetables and fruit, and put in a chicken pen just to rub it in even more",1,australia,"Doubtful, there are so many ways they could have rejiggered Labor's NBN plan to make it their own; FTTB in metro areas so they don't have to deal with the absolute shitfight of pulling new cables through poorly constructed apartment blocks in the city and dealing with body corporates, draw down the 93% of homes target and use more wireless, or hell just lay the fiber and if you want your home connected you pay for it. They could have even done some creative accounting to fudge the numbers and hoodwink people on how much it really cost, then they can make the farcical claim that they rolled out a world class network better than labor could. But they didn't pick any of those options, they didn't even power on with a real FTTN with a adequate upgrade path. Lots of countries have rolled out FTTN and then moved to FTTP, and although it's undesirable it's better than the mixed technology model they're going with now. Let's not forget that years ago when the outline of the NBN first surfaced many felt that Labor's plan was lacking. Many wanted to see a google fiber type P2P network and like many I was bitterly disappointed with the decision to go with GPON. Labor chose a slightly inferior model which has now been replaced with the worst possible option imaginable. Canceling the project entirely would be better because then at least the idea could be revisited eventually without being stuck in a quagmire of old, knackered technology. The LNPs primary goal is to scuttle the NBN forever, make it such a disaster that it's unrecoverable in 3 years at the next election. Labor have been awfully quiet on the subject and it's infuriating. I'm fortunate and have a good income, I'd happily pay upwards of 5,000 to have my home connected to the NBN tomorrow. If you could do it tomorrow Id pay double that. Just show me where to send the cheque. I have no words for how disappointed I am on this policy, it was managed sub optimally by labor but at least the tumultuous road would have led somewhere beneficial. The LNP are now just being vindictive to the detriment of the Australian IT industry's future. Someone wake me in 3 years."

He sits down at a table quietly and for like 6 straight minutes contemplates what he wants while counting his money, We have SEVENTEEN things on our menu, just point to what you want! It requires little thought! He finally gets his ass off the chair and he's still sweating! You have just been sitting down for 6 minutes?! Anyway. He comes up, asks for one of our meals, and asks for it large (why am I not surprised?) and a medium milkshake. He tries to make a little small chat and says the reason he is so sweaty is because he walked here (like a 15 minute walk?). Maybe if this loser stopped eating here he wouldn't be so damn sweaty walking for 15 minutes. His total comes out to $12.01 and he says he is a dollar short, so he asks to remove the milkshake and just get the meal with a regular drink. You idiot, you sat there for like six minutes contemplating what to buy with your money, are you so stupid you could not figure out your total would be $12.01? Anyway, after that his total is $9.50, surprisingly he pays with all one dollar bills and a 50 cent coin, but this isn't excusable for what hes put me through so far. though I CLEARLY SAW THREE MORE INDIVIDUAL DOLLARS IN HIS WALLET (he could have got the milkshake anyway, wtf?)
